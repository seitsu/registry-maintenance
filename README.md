## Machine-readable Domain Name Registry Maintenance Notifications

### The Goal
The goal was to create a machine-readable domain name registry maintenance notification format to make things easier for domain name registrars to keep up with maintenance notices. Especially with more than 1,200 top-level domains it would be mutually beneficial.

### The Current Status
This idea was further developed, moved to [EPP] and ended up as an [IETF draft]. We hope that we will able to create an [RFC] out of that.

The original idea about a RESTful webservice was put on hold.

For more historic details please review the old [README].
